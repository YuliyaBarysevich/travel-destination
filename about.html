        <p>Hey, My name is <em>Yuliya</em>, and I am from Belarus. Currently I am a student at Code Fellows,  pursuing a new found passion in Software Engineering. I have 4+ years background in social media management, content marketing, and branding. I decided to change my career because I felt less and less engaged with the job as moving up and getting experienced.  I'm extremely enjoying in learning new features every day. When doing my projects I unstoppably focus on the work and feel so great about what I created.</p>
